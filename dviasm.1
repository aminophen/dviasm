.SH NAME
DVIasm \- a TeX utility program for editing DVI files directly
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBdviasm\fR [<\fIoptions\fR>] <\fIdvi_file\fR>|<\fIdvi_dump_file\fR>
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBDVIasm\fR is a TeX utility program which is
designed for editing DeVice-Independent (DVI) files directly.
It consists of a single Python script, dviasm.py,
in a human readable text format.
It runs on any platform in which Python 3 is installed.
.TP 2
Features of \fBDVIasm\fR includes:
.IP
1) Disassemble a DVI file (or XeTeX XDV file) into
a human-readable text file, the contents of which are easy to modify.
.IP
2) Assembles the output text file back to the binary format.

.SH OPTIONS
.PP
.TP 10
\fB--version\fR
Show program's version number and exit.
.TP 10
\fB-h\fR, \fB--help\fR
Show this help message and exit.
.TP 10
\fB-u\fR <\fISTR\fR>, \fB--unit=\fR<\fISTR\fR>
Set unit [default: `pt'].
Allowed values are: `sp', `pt', `bp', `mm', `cm' and `in'.
.TP 10
\fB-o\fR <\fIFILE\fR>, \fB--output=\fR<\fIFILE\fR>
Set filename for output instead of stdout.
.TP 10
\fB-e\fR <\fISTR\fR>, \fB--encoding=\fR<\fISTR\fR>
Set encoding for input/output of dumped text [default: `utf8'].
Allowed values are: `ascii', `latin1', `utf8', `sjis' and `eucjp'.
When used with the option \fB-p\fR (or \fB--ptex\fR),
allowed values are only `utf8', `sjis' and `eucjp'.
.RS 10
# NOTE: This feature does not support dumping through stdout.
.RE
.TP 10
\fB-x\fR <\fISTR\fR>, \fB--xxx-encoding=\fR<\fISTR\fR>
Set encoding for interpreting `xxx:' strings [default: `none'].
Allowed values are: `none', `utf8', `sjis' and `eucjp'.
.RS 10
This option allows users to specify the correct encoding for
dumping/compiling the contents of \\special.
.TP 2
Typical usages are as follows:
.IP
1) By default, the contents of \\special are dumped/compiled
as byte-to-byte escape sequences in `\\x..' format.
This would suffice when you don't need to read/edit
the contents of \\special.
.IP
3) For XeTeX and upTeX users, `\fB-x utf8\fR' would be useful
since these engines use UTF-8 to encode strings inside
\\special commands.
.IP
2) For pTeX users with ISO-2022-JP-encoded DVI,
it would be helpful to select the appropriate option
`\fB-x eucjp\fR' (for Unix) or `\fB-x sjis\fR' (for Windows)
to be consistent with the internal Kanji encoding used by
pTeX engine.
.RE
.TP 10
\fB-t\fR <\fIINT\fR>, \fB--tabsize=\fR<\fIINT\fR>
Set tab size for push/pop [default: 2].
.TP 10
\fB-p\fR, \fB--ptex\fR
Dump and compile ISO-2022-JP-encoded DVI for Japanese pTeX.
This option is required to decode or encode Japanese characters
being typeset (using `set2' or `put2') properly.
.TP 10
\fB-s\fR <\fISTR\fR>, \fB--subfont=\fR<\fISTR\fR>
Specify the list of fonts with UCS2 subfont scheme
in the comma-separated format.
If <\fISTR\fR> is empty, the pre-defined internal subfont list
is disabled.
.RS 10
This option would be useful for example when using CJK package.
